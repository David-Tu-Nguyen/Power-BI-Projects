## Main objective

- **Revenue Analysis:** Calculate total sales,...

The questions we will answer through this analysis are the following :

- What is the trend of total sales over the months covered in the data?
- What are the peak hours for sales?
- How do sales vary across days of the week?

## Insights
**Revenue and transactions**
- Monthly sales have consistently grown since the second month (February), reaching their peak in the sixth month (June) across all stores.
- 72.06% of revenue is generated during weekdays for all stores
- On weekdays, Hell's Kitchen experiences its highest sales on Friday and Tuesday, signifying these as the busiest days. Similarly, Astoria's busiest weekdays are Thursday and Monday. Lower Manhattan's busiest weekday is Monday.

**Store hours**
- Hell's Kitchen and Lower Manhattan operate from 6:00 to 20:00, while Astoria is open from 7:00 to 19:00.

## Recommendations
Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided :
**- Focus on Best-Selling Products**
Coffee Beans are your top seller. To boost sales even more, offer a seasonal “Buy One Get One Free” deal. Start the promotion a month before winter so customers stock up early, as many make coffee at home during colder months.

**- Increase Sales in Quiet Months**
January and February usually bring fewer sales. To attract more customers, try promotions like reward cards or giving customers a free drink on their birthday. These offers can encourage people to visit, sign up, and spend more during slow periods.

**- Make Better Use of Slow Hours and Products**
Sales are lowest around 8PM. To fix this, introduce “end-of-day” discounts to bring in more evening customers. Also, switch out slow-selling products with new or seasonal ones to keep things exciting and fresh.

**- Listen to Customers Regularly**
At the end of each season, send a short survey asking customers about the service, products, and their overall experience. Their feedback will help improve your offerings and grow the business over time.
